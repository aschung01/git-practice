        <h1>University study is not interesting yet..</h1>
        <p>
            I am not yet interested in university studies.
            Should I take a semester off?
            Yes, maybe I should.
            Graduation and GPA is not that important to me.
            Gaining experience in the community and gaining insight is more important.
